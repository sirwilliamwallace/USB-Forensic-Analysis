## Overview

This project documents a full **digital forensic analysis** of a suspicious 2GB USB flash drive, conducted as part of a university module in Digital Forensics. Using a **Raspberry Pi 4** configured with **Kali Linux** and remote-secured via **Tailscale**, I followed a professional-grade investigation workflow including evidence imaging, hashing, file carving, and advanced analysis of hidden malicious payloads (ZIP bombs).

## Tools & Technologies

- Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi 4 (custom SSH-only setup)
- FTK Imager (image creation + MD5 & SHA-1 verification)
- Foremost (file carving)
- Binwalk & Strings (advanced ZIP analysis)
- Tailscale (secure remote access)

---

## Key Steps

### 1. Write-Blocked Imaging

- USB was imaged using FTK Imager v4.7.3 with a USB write blocker.
- MD5 & SHA-1 hashes were created and verified to ensure integrity.

MD5: 958eaee85ace515af653944635913209
SHA-1: a641ff2f1b66fa37b9605f8aa0cf6a033fd02e06
```

### 2. Secure Analysis Environment

- Raspberry Pi 4 running Kali Linux configured with `USER` as sole user.
- Remote SSH access is locked to the examiner's device via Tailscale.

### 3. File Carving & Threat Discovery

- Image file `usb-raw-img.dd.001` analysed using Foremost.
- Two ZIP files were carved: both later flagged as corrupted/malicious.

```bash
foremost -i usb-raw-img.dd.001 -o recovered_files
```
### 4. Safe Static Analysis

- Binwalk, Strings, and Zipinfo were used to examine ZIP files without extracting them.

- Found patterns of repeated JPEGs and text files: indicators of ZIP bombs

## Legal & Ethical Considerations
- All actions complied with GDPR, data integrity, and chain-of-custody protocols.

- Confidential or suspicious data was not stored on personal machines.

- Tailscale ensured an isolated forensic analysis environment.

### Key findings

- ZIP bombs were embedded with repetitive, oversized, corrupted files.

- Designed to crash systems or delay forensic work.

- Proper isolation and safe tools mitigated risks successfully.
